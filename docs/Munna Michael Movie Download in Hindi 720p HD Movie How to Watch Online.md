The film was released on July 21, 2017 and received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. The film was praised for its dance sequences and performances, but criticized for its weak plot and direction. The film was also a box office flop, grossing only $189,105 worldwide against a budget of $9.4 million[^1^] [^2^].
 
If you are a fan of Munna Michael and want to watch it online, you have a few options. You can stream the full HD movie on JioCinema, a digital platform that offers movies, TV shows and music videos for Jio subscribers[^3^]. You can also rent or buy the movie on YouTube, Google Play Movies or iTunes. However, these platforms may not have the Hindi version of the movie available.
 
Alternatively, you can download the movie from various websites that offer Bollywood movies for free. However, these websites are illegal and may contain viruses or malware that can harm your device. Moreover, downloading or watching pirated movies is a crime and can land you in legal trouble. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse any such websites.
 
The best way to enjoy Munna Michael is to watch it legally on a licensed platform that respects the rights of the filmmakers and artists. You can also support the film industry by avoiding piracy and encouraging others to do the same.
  
Munna Michael is a tribute to the legendary pop star Michael Jackson, who inspired millions of people with his music and dance. The film features some spectacular dance numbers by Tiger Shroff, who showcases his flexibility and agility as a dancer. The film also has some catchy songs composed by various artists, such as Main Hoon, Ding Dang and Beparwah.
 
However, Munna Michael is not just a dance film. It also tries to be a comedy, a romance and a thriller, but fails to deliver on any of these fronts. The film suffers from a weak script, poor direction and inconsistent performances. The film has many clichÃ©s, loopholes and illogical scenes that test the patience of the viewers. The film also drags on for too long, with a runtime of 140 minutes.
 
The film's saving grace is Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who plays Mahinder Fauji, a gangster who wants to learn dancing to impress his love interest. Siddiqui brings some comic relief and charm to his role, despite being miscast as a villain. Nidhhi Agerwal, who makes her debut as Dolly, a dancer and Munna's love interest, is decent but has little scope to showcase her talent. Tiger Shroff, who plays the titular role of Munna Michael, is impressive as a dancer but lacks charisma and emotion as an actor.
 
Munna Michael is a film that tries to do too much but achieves too little. It is a film that will appeal only to die-hard fans of Tiger Shroff and Michael Jackson. For others, it is a tedious and forgettable affair.
